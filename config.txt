# The following option disables the on-board bluetooth module, which allows RTEMS to use the console
#   on the Raspberry Pi Zero W and Raspberry Pi 3 models.  
dtoverlay=disable-bt

# The uart_2ndstage=1 option enables debug output from the firmware
#   This debug info is useful to see what device trees and kernel the boot loader is 
#   attempting to boot. 
uart_2ndstage=1

# kernel_address=0x200000 is needed for RTEMS - see the raspberrypi linkscript
kernel_address=0x200000

# By default the firmware will boot an image called kernel.img on the single core
#  models. This is what you should name your raspberrypi BSP images. The image
#  format is a stripped binary. Example:
#  arm-rtems6-objcopy -Obinary ticker.exe kernel.img
#
# The rasperrypi2 and 3 will boot an image called kernel7.img
#  That is the name for the raspberrypi2 BSP images.
#
# You can specify the image that will be booted with the kernel= option here:
# kernel=ticker.bin 
# again, the image must be a stripped binary)
